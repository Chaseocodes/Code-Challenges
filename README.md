## How It's Made:
I just add the coding challenges to Javascript files.

## Optimizations
I have been getting more into Data structures and algorithms, so that is helping with making my code more efficient.  

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Code wars and leetcode have definitely pushed my knowledge and prowess.
